= Contributing

You can contribute new test content in two main ways:

. As a test definer *specifying a test*
. As a test developer *implementing a test*

Thus, in terms of a "good PR" there are the following options:

. A PR providing *test specifications* with *reference implementations*
. A PR providing *test specifications only*
. A PR providing *reference implementations* (for existing test specifications)

For guidance on contributing a test specification see
link:./CONTRIBUTING_TESTSPEC.adoc[this guide].

For guidance on contributing a reference implementation see
link:./CONTRIBUTING_REFIMPL.adoc[this guide].

= Contributing

You can contribute to the repo in two main ways, as a test definer specifying a new test; and as a test developer implementing a new test. Thus, in terms of a "good PR" there are two options:

1. A PR providing test specifications only.
2. A PR providing test specifications and reference implementation.

See link:./DEFINERS.adoc[Test definers guide] for information on how to add a new test specification and link:./DEVS.adoc[Test developers guide] for information on how to add a reference implementation for an existing test specification.

= Contributing Reference Implementations

This document covers contributing a reference implementation for a test case.

(Skip to the end to for <<an-example>>.)

== Writing a reference implementation

The exact content of a reference implementation is specific to the test case.
Existing reference implementations are a source of inspiration.

Each reference implementation must be in the same directory as the test
specification (`testspec.adoc`). It is ok for the reference implementation to
be a symbolic link to a shared implementation in a different directory.

For example:

* https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/DPLL-to-PHC/PRTC-A/testimpl.py[reference implementation], a symbolic link
* https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/DPLL-to-PHC/testimpl.py[shared Python implementation], the target of the symbolic link

Reference implementations must:

* Be appropriately documented
* Be runnable from a shell/the command line
* Take test input parameters from an associated configuration file
  (see <<test-input-params>>)
* Print results as a line of JSON-encoded text to stdout
  (see <<test-output>>)
* Exit with code zero if a result was produced, non-zero otherwise

[[test-input-params]]
== Test input parameters

Test input parameters must be specified in an associated configuration file
named `config.yaml`. This file must be supplied in the same directory as the
reference implementation.

An example of a reference implementation with its configuration file:

* https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/DPLL-to-PHC/PRTC-A/testimpl.py[reference implementation]
* https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/DPLL-to-PHC/PRTC-A/config.yaml[configuration file]

[[test-output]]
== Test output

A reference implementation must print its results as a line of JSON-encoded text.
The JSON value must be a JSON object:

* including a pair at key `"result"` with a value of:
** `true` on test success;
** `false` on test failure; or,
** `"error"` indicating failure to produce a result
* including a pair at key `"reason"` with a value of:
** a string providing any qualification of the result; or,
** `null` (indicating no qualification of the result)
* optionally including a pair at key `"timestamp"` with a value of:
** a string capturing when the test was started (see <<timestamp>>); or,
** `null` (indicating no timestamp)
* optionally including a pair at key `"duration"` with a value of:
** a non-negative number, the duration of the test in seconds; or,
** `null` (indicating no duration)
* optionally including a pair at key `"analysis"` with a value of:
** an object providing any relevant structured summarization of the result

All other key/value pairs are reserved for future use.

[[timestamp]]
=== timestamp values

This section prescribes the format of a timestamp string, in order to promote
consistency and avoid ambiguity.

A timestamp string is an
https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html[ISO 8601 date-time string]
representing a
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-4.1[UTC time value]
as per the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339 date-time ABNF rule].

For example, using the https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/date[GNU date command]:

    $ date -u -Iseconds
    2023-09-07T08:05:57+00:00

== Manage dependencies

git submodules are used to manage the dependencies this repository has on other
repositories. Before raising a PR, ensure you have tested with the submodule
versions on this repository's `main` branch.

To pull the latest changes present in dependent submodules:

[source,console]
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

== Publishing a reference implementation

A reference implememtation is considered (publicly) published when the
following conditions become true for the first time:

* The corresponding test specification is published
  (see link:./CONTRIBUTING_TESTSPEC.adoc#publish-test-spec[Publishing a test specification])
* The reference implementation is on the `main` branch of this repository

== Changing a reference implementation

Once published, a reference implementation is closed to modification.

(Conceptually, a published reference implementation can be "changed" by
providing a new version of it with a new version of the test specification.
How new versions of a test are to be handled is not yet defined.)

Changes to _unpublished_ reference implementations can be accepted.

== Submitting a PR

In addition to common good PR hygiene practices, a PR containing reference
implementations must satisfy the following:

* The PR must provide sufficient context for it to be reviewed as a single unit
* The PR must contain a coherent set of new and changed test cases
* No changes to published tests
* Each reference implementation must be in the same directory as the test
  specification (`testspec.adoc`) for the test case
* Each reference implementation must have an associated configuration file
  `config.yaml` in the same directory defining test input parameters
* Each reference implementation must provide example data files demonstrating
  test success
* Each reference implementation must provide example data files demonstrating
  test failure

Each reference implementation should ideally follow consistent practices with
existing similar reference implementations (by language, type of test, ...)

[[an-example]]
== An example reference implementation

The example demonstrated here is this
https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/1PPS-to-DPLL/PRTC-A/testimpl.py[reference implementation]
(which is actually a symbolic link to this
https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/1PPS-to-DPLL/testimpl.py[shared Python implementation]).

This reference implementation takes lines of JSON data as input. This is an
example of data produced by a collector such as
https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-collection-tools[vse-sync-collection-tools].
Alternatively your reference implementation could use system log files, for
example those produced by `linux-ptp-daemon`.

(In all cases, it is the reference implementation's responsibility to ensure it
parses and handles its input data correctly.)

Example log files for test success and failure are provided alongside the test
cases:

* https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/1PPS-to-DPLL/examples/dpll-PRTCA-accept.dat[test success for PRTC-A only]
* https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-sync-test/blob/main/tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/1PPS-to-DPLL/examples/dpll-reject.dat[test failure]

The following demonstrates test success with this reference implementation:

[source,console]
$ cd tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/1PPS-to-DPLL/PRTC-A
$ PPATH=../../../../../../vse-sync-pp/src
$ PYTHONPATH=$PPATH python3 testimpl.py  ../examples/dpll-PRTCA-accept.dat
{"result": true, "reason": null, "analysis": {"duration": 2458.27, "terror": {"units": "ns", "min": -5.14, "max": 5.58, "range": 10.72, "mean": -0.001, "stddev": 2.453, "variance": 6.016}}}

The following demonstrates test failure with the same reference implementation
but different data:

[source,console]
$ cd tests/sync/G.8272/time-error-in-locked-mode/1PPS-to-DPLL/PRTC-A
$ PPATH=../../../../../../vse-sync-pp/src
$ PYTHONPATH=$PPATH python3 testimpl.py  ../examples/dpll-reject.dat
{"result": false, "reason": "short test duration", "analysis": {"duration": 475.7922967, "terror": {"units": "ns", "min": -3.49, "max": 5.84, "range": 9.33, "mean": 0.03, "stddev": 2.342, "variance": 5.486}}}

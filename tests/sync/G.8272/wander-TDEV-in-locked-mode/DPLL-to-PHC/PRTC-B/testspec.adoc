= G.8272 wander-TDEV-in-locked-mode DPLL-to-PHC PRTC-B

https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[G.8272 Section 6.2 Table 4] specifies
requirements on the accuracy of the wander-TDEV, i.e. wander
expressed in time deviation or TDEV, for
https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[PRTC-B] under normal, locked conditions. (For
the sake of simplicity wander-TDEV will be denoted by TDEV from here on.)
This test focusses on one observation point in this system: the internal path
from DPLL to PHC. The purpose of this test is to identify when the TDEV
observed at this point is considered independently unacceptable.

IMPORTANT: It is critical to note that the results of this test are only valid
when both the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT) have been
independently validated. While requirements on their acceptability are not
defined here, it is noted that they include timestamping accuracy.

== Goal

Verify that the TDEV introduced between DPLL and PHC under
normal, locked operating conditions is not greater than 100% of the overall TDEV requirement for https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[PRTC-B].
An observation interval of 10000 seconds covers practically all masks. Note that the minimum test window period for TDEV is twelve times the maximum observation interval in accordance with ITU-T recommendation https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.811-199709-I/en[G.811].

== Scope

* Ignore samples in an initial transient window
* Verify samples in the test window

== Out of scope

* Independent validation of the test environment
* Independent validation of the SUT
* Provision SUT

== Acceptance criteria

1. All filtered TDEV samples during each observation interval
   are less than 100% of overall TDEV accuracy requirement
2. The time output is locked for the test window
3. The test window is at least 1000 seconds long

== Test procedure

1. Establish normal, locked conditions per
   https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[G.8272 Section 6]
2. Capture at least 1000 seconds of `ts2phc` log data
3. Verify log data meets acceptance criteria

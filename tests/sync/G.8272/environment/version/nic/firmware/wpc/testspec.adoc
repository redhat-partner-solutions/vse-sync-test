=== G.8272 environment version nic firmware wpc

To run the tests focused on the characterization of T-GM performance, it is needed to satisfy that the environment is ready at Hardware level and Software level. This test focuses on ensuring the WPC NIC firmware version is valid to run the specific T-GM performance tests.

IMPORTANT: It is critical to note that the results of this test are only for ensuring the validation of the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT).

==== Goal

Verify that the WPC NIC firmware version is acceptable to trigger the performance characterization of the T-GM.

==== Scope

* Independent Validation of test Environment
* T-GM clocks
* WPC NIC device validation

==== Out of scope

* T-BC clocks
* T-TSC clocks


==== Acceptance criteria

1. WPC NIC firmware version is exactly the version specified in the test configuration file.


==== Test procedure

1. The procedure leverages specific collector tooling to gather `WPC NIC` Firmware version. 
2. Verify gathered data meets acceptance criteria

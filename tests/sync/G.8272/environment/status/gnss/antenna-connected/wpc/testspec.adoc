= G.8272 environment status gnss antenna-connected wpc

To run the tests focused on the characterization of T-GM performance, it is needed to satisfy that the environment is ready at Hardware level and Software level. This test focuses on ensuring the GPS antenna connected to the GNSS receiver is in valid state to run the specific T-GM performance tests.

IMPORTANT: It is critical to note that the results of this test are only for ensuring the validation of the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT).

== Goal

Verify that the status of the GPS antenna is acceptable to trigger the performance characterization of the T-GM.

== Scope

* Independent Validation of test Environment
* T-GM clocks
* GPS antenna status validation


== Out of scope

* T-BC clocks
* T-TSC clocks


== Acceptance criteria

1. GPS antenna state is valid for T-GM.


== Test procedure

1. The procedure leverages specific collector tooling to gather the GPS antenna status.
2. Verify gathered data meets acceptance criteria.

= G.8272 time-error-in-locked-mode 1PPS-to-DPLL PRTC-A

https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[G.8272 Section 6.1] specifies
requirements on the accuracy of the time output of
https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[PRTC-A] under normal, locked conditions.
This test focusses on one observation point in this system: the internal path
between the 1PPS input to the DPLL and the 1PPS output from the DPLL. The purpose of this test is to identify when the time error of the phase offset observed at this point is considered independently unacceptable.

IMPORTANT: It is critical to note that the results of this test are only valid
when both the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT) have been
independently validated. While requirements on their acceptability are not
defined here, it is noted that they include timestamping accuracy.

== Goal

Verify that the unfiltered time error of the 1PPS DPLL under
normal, locked operating conditions is not greater than 10% of the overall time
output accuracy requirement for https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[PRTC-A].

== Scope

* Ignore samples in an initial transient window
* Verify samples in the test window

== Out of scope

* Independent validation of the test environment
* Independent validation of the SUT
* Provision SUT

== Acceptance criteria

1. All samples in the test window have an unfiltered time error
   of less than 10% of overall time output accuracy requirement
2. The 1PPS DPLL is in `locked and holdover acquired` state for the test window
3. The test window is at least 1000 seconds long

== Test procedure

1. Establish normal, locked conditions per
   https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[G.8272 Section 6.1]
2. Capture at least 1000 seconds of `DPLL` log data
3. Verify log data meets acceptance criteria

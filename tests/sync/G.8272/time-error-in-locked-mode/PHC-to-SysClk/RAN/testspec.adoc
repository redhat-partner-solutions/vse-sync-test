= time-error-in-locked-mode PHC-to-SysClk RAN

This test focusses on one observation point in this system: the internal path
from PHC and System Clock (SysClk). The purpose of this test is to identify when the time error
observed at this point is considered unacceptable for RAN workloads.

IMPORTANT: It is critical to note that the results of this test are only valid
when both the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT) have been
independently validated. While requirements on their acceptability are not
defined here, it is noted that they include timestamping accuracy.

== Goal

Verify that the unfiltered time error introduced between PHC and SycClk under
normal, locked operating conditions is not greater than the overall time
error allowed by RAN applications.

== Scope

* Ignore samples in an initial transient window
* Verify samples in the test window

== Out of scope

* Independent validation of the test environment
* Independent validation of the SUT
* Provision SUT

== Acceptance criteria

1. All samples in the test window have an unfiltered time error
   of less than the overall time error requirement
2. The time error is locked for the test window
3. The test window is at least 1000 seconds long

== Test procedure

1. Establish normal, locked conditions per 
2. Capture at least 1000 seconds of `phc2sys` log data
3. Verify log data meets acceptance criteria

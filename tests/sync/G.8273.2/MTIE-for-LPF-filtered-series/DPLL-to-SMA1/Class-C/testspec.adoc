= G.8273.2 MTIE-for-LPF-filtered-series DPLL-to-SMA1 Class-C

https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8273.2/en[G.8273.2 Section 6.2 Table 3] specifies
requirements on the accuracy of the MTIE,
expressed in maximum time interval error or MTIE, for
https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8273.2/en[Class-C] under normal, locked conditions. (For
the sake of simplicity MTIE will be denoted by MTIE from here on.)
This test focusses on one observation point in this system: the internal path between the DPLL SMA output from the main card to the input on DPLL SMA input of the following card. The purpose of this test is to identify when the MTIE
observed at this point is considered independently unacceptable.

IMPORTANT: It is critical to note that the results of this test are only valid
when both the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT) have been
independently validated. While requirements on their acceptability are not
defined here, it is noted that they include timestamping accuracy.

== Goal

Verify that the MTIE of the 1PPS DPLL under
normal, locked operating conditions is not greater than 100% of the overall MTIE requirement for https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8273.2/en[Class-C].
An observation interval of 10000 seconds covers practically all masks. Note that the test window period for MTIE is equivalent to the maximum observation interval in accordance with ITU-T recommendation https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.811-199709-I/en[G.811].

== Scope

* Ignore samples in an initial transient window
* Verify samples in the test window

== Out of scope

* Independent validation of the test environment
* Independent validation of the SUT
* Provision SUT

== Acceptance criteria

1. All filtered MTIE samples during each observation interval
   are less than 100% of overall MTIE accuracy requirement
2. The time output is locked for the test window
3. The test window is at least 1000 seconds long

== Test procedure

1. Establish normal, locked conditions per
   https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8273.2/en[G.8273.2 Section 6]
2. Capture at least 1000 seconds of `DPLL` log data
3. Verify log data meets acceptance criteria

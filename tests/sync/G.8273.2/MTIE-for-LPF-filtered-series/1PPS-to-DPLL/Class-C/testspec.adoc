G.8273.2 MTIE-for-LPF-filtered-series 1PPS-to-DPLL

When the T-BC/T-TSC is operating in locked mode synchronized to both a wander-free time reference at the PTP input and a wander-free frequency reference at the physical layer frequency input, the MTIE and TDEV under constant temperature (within ±1 K) at the PTP and 1 PPS outputs, 6 Rec. ITU-T G.8273.2/Y.1368.2 (06/2023) measured through a first-order low-pass filter with bandwidth of 0.1 Hz, should meet the limits in Table 7-4 and Table 7-5 respectively.

❗	It is critical to note that the results of this test are only valid when both the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT) have been independently validated. While requirements on their acceptability are not defined here, it is noted that they include timestamping accuracy.

Goal

Verify that the MTIE introduced between DPLL and PHC under normal, locked operating conditions is not greater than 100% of the overall MTIE requirement. An observation interval increased by 10000 seconds covers practically all masks. Note that the test window period for MTIE is equivalent to the maximum observation interval in accordance with ITU-T recommendation

Scope
•	Ignore samples in an initial transient window
•	Verify samples in the test window

Out of scope
•	Independent validation of the test environment
•	Independent validation of the SUT
•	Provision SUT

Acceptance criteria
1.	All filtered MTIE samples during each observation interval are less than 100% of overall MTIE accuracy requirement
2.	The time output is locked for the test window
3.	The test window is at least 1000 seconds long

Test procedure
1.	Establish normal, locked conditions per G.8273.2 Section 7.4
2.	Capture at least 1000 seconds
3.	Verify log data meets acceptance criteria

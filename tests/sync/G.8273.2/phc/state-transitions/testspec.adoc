= PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) Clock State Transitions

IMPORTANT: It is critical to note that the results of this test are only valid
when both the test environment and the System Under Test (SUT) have been
independently validated. While requirements on their acceptability are not
defined here, it is noted that they include timestamping accuracy.

== Goal

Verify that the T-GM observed clock class transitions according to the following diagram:

flowchart TB
    A(FREERUN) --> B(LOCKED)
    A --> A
    B --> C(HOLDOVER_IN_SPEC)
    B --> B
    C --> D(HOLDOVER_OUT_OF_SPEC)
    D --> D
    C -->B
    D --> B

== Scope

* T-GM Clock class state transitions

== Out of scope

* Independent validation of the test environment
* Independent validation of the SUT
* Provision SUT

== Acceptance criteria

. PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) announced `clockClass` states are valid as per https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8275.1-202211-I/e[G.8275.1 section 6.4 Table 3]  and `clockClass` state transitions follow the diagram above

== Test procedure

. Capture at least 1000 seconds of T-GM `clockClass` announcements 
. Gather the values identifying the announced T-GM `clockClass` for each sample of log data  
. Ensure that `clockClass` transitions between consecutive samples meet the acceptance criteria

= G.8272 time-error-in-locked-mode PRTC-A (unfiltered)

This test verifies that the unfiltered time error of the
https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[PRTC-A] indicates accurate time output
under normal, locked operating conditions.

== Goal

Verify that the time output under normal, locked operating conditions is
accurate to within 100ns.

== Scope

* Ignore samples in an initial transient window
* Verify accuracy in the test window

== Out of scope

* Set up the System Under Test (SUT)
* Ensure the SUT is connected to an appropriate external reference clock
* Establish normal, locked operating conditions

== Acceptance criteria

1. All samples in the test window have a time error less than 100ns
2. The time output is locked for the test window
3. The test window is at least 1000 seconds long

== Test procedure

1. Provision SUT
2. Lock the SUT to the external reference clock
3. Capture at least 1000 seconds of `ts2phc` log data
4. Verify log data meets acceptance criteria

= G.8272 time-error-in-locked-mode PRTC-A (unfiltered)

This test verifies that the unfiltered time error of the
https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8272/en[PRTC-A] indicates accurate time output
under normal, locked operating conditions.

== Goal

Verify that the time output under normal, locked operating conditions is
accurate to within 100ns.

== Scope

* Ignore time output samples in an initial transient window
* Verify time output accuracy in the test window

== Out of scope

* Set up the System Under Test (SUT)
* Ensure the SUT is connected to an applicable primary time standard
* Establish normal, locked operating conditions

== Acceptance criteria

1. No sample in the test window has a time error greater than 100ns
2. The time output is locked for the test window
